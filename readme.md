# HTML/CSS Developer Assessment

* SASS for CSS compiling
* No Javascript implemented
* Responsive and mobile friendly, tested on iPhone (landscape and portrait) and tablet (landscape and portrait)
* Developed and tested in Chrome

## Notes
* SVG logo that was supplied was used, although the greys are extremely light on the white background and the blue is cyan and it doesn't match the mock
* Inspiration was taken from the original site for the mobile/responsive layout
* As there was no mobile-friendly banner image for the Encompass NG background (that would lay out vertically instead of horizontally) and because the Encompass logo was not baked into the laptop image (and this caused issues when the browser was resized), banner image is hidden completely and replaced with a solid grey color background instead. Ideally, this would be done with a vertical image with gradiant instead though.
